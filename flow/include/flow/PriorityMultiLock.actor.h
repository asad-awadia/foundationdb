// A multi user lock with a concurrent holder limit where waiters request a lock with a priority
// id and are granted locks based on a total concurrency and relative weights of the current active
// priorities.  Priority id's must start at 0 and are sequential integers.
//
// Scheduling logic
// Let
// 	 weights[n] = configured weight for priority n
//   waiters[n] = the number of waiters for priority n
//   runnerCounts[n] = number of runners at priority n
//
//   totalPendingWeights = sum of weights for all priorities with waiters[n] > 0
//   When waiters[n] becomes == 0, totalPendingWeights -= weights[n]
//   When waiters[n] becomes  > 0, totalPendingWeights += weights[n]
//
//   The total capacity of a priority to be considered when launching tasks is
//     ceil(weights[n] / totalPendingWeights * concurrency)
//
// For improved memory locality the properties mentioned above are stored as priorities[n].<property>
// in the actual implementation.
//
// The interface is similar to FlowMutex except that lock holders can just drop the lock to release it.

//   Lock lock = wait(prioritylock.lock(priorityLevel));
//   lock.release();  // Explicit release, or
//   // let lock and all copies of lock go out of scope to release
